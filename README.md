# MiniCLI

This is a super simple framework for building a command line interface using PHP.

## Idea

The idea for this, and the author of the articles I am getting this from can be found [here - the original repo for Erika Heidi's Minicli](https://github.com/minicli/minicli).

### Personal challenges

I am coding this as a _Maiden Voyage/Project_ on my first installation of a Linux distro, so I want to see if I can do the whole thing from the command line itself. Every file in this repo, including this README file was written and/or edited using only **nano**.

Already it's shown me that I know more than I give myself credit for, but I am really interested to see how much more I will learn by doing this type of exercise.
